# Klack

Klack is a twist on Slack, the popular corporate messenger.

Klack allows users to communicate with each other across different "channels." Messages are broadcasted
in real time, and users are free to switch between existing channels by selecting one from the list in
the sidebar (or menu, on mobile browsers). New users will be automatically connected to the #General
channel upon sign-in.

**1. Channels**
- Channels can be created by any user, by clicking the add (+) button at the top of the "channels" section
in the sidebar (or menu, on mobile browsers).

**2. Messages**
- Messages are specific to their respective channel.
- Messages cached by the server are limited to 100 per channel.

**3. File Uploads**
- Klack also supports uploading files, which are automatically linked for access in a channel's chat
interface.
- To upload a file, click the attachment button (paperclip icon) in the bottom-right corner of the
interface/chat-box.
